# My Super Hero Starter Pack

This is a starter pack for the new apprentices in order to get in touch with stash, sourcetree, terminal, git and a develop environment.
The goal is that you get familiar with twig, json and sass, too.

Feel free to ask any question.

Now the task:

##Your Super Hero

Build a Onepager that presents your personal Super Hero. Regardless of the Universe (Marvel, DC or yours).
The technical guidelines will be to use Sass, that will be compiled to css, JavaScript ES6 (if you would like to use any JS) and twig.



## Setup


For the setup you'll need to install node, npm and
node: v8.9.1,
npm: 6.1.0

It's recommended that you use the Node Version Manager to install and manage Node versions


    $ nvm install && nvm use
    $ npm install


### Development

Starting development-server:

    $ npm run start

### Production

Building a dist folder:

    $ npm run build


So feel free to work together on one page or create new branches for each hero.

Let the game begin.
